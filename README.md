# Day-Planner
This simple day planner works in a way that will allow the user to store their plans for the day by hour in local storage so that their plans will persist even when the page is refreshed. The user will type in their plans into the text areas and when the user presses the plus button on the right, it will save their plans. These text areas are also color coded to show the time indiciated on the planner as compared to the current time. I used jQuery to allow for the functionality throughout the app. Comments can be found in the script file.
